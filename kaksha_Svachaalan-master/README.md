## Introduction:
    This covid has bring lots of challenge to the life of students.
    Daily students have to sign-in in gmeet making their life boring.So,here we
    come with a idea which automates the life of students.Here we make
    notes what teachers speaks,takes the screenshot of screen after every 5
    minutes interval.Now sometimes what happens is that there is some
    random person joins the class and takes the class in wrong direction.So
    keeping this in mind we have designed a sentiment analysis system
    which detects negative words from the notes and send it to higher authorites.
    Now sometimes what happens is,due to some urgent work in home student gets busy
    in work.So when teachers calls his name he gets a desktop notification
    and again starts attending the class.
